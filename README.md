# Enhanced Chromatin Accessibility Contributes to  X-chromosome Dosage Compensation in Mammals

:tada: **Welcome** to the GitHub repository for our manuscript entitled ["Enhanced Chromatin Accessibility Contributes to X-chromosome Dosage Compensation in Mammals"](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02518-5) published in Genome Biology.

## Loom files for scRNAseq data visualization

As a resource to community we provide .loom files that contain UMAP-clustering, cluster annotation, expression and gene regulatory data from datasets analyzed in the manuscript. 

Loom files can be downloaded here: [GSE153846](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153846) using the http links at the bottom of the page. After unzipping, you can browse interactively using [SCope platform](https://scope.aertslab.org/#/0e367043-465c-442d-8b64-4af393567818/*/welcome). In order to browse the datasets, upload loom files by clicking on "Upload new dataset" in the menu on the left-side of SCope website. Uploading may take a few minutes. Successful upload will activate a private, temporary session for the user. Each session expires after 5 days, but can be renewed by re-uploading the loom file. 

Standalone SCope apps for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/releases).

SCope was developed and is maintained by [Aerts lab](https://www.aertslab.org/).
