## Loom files for data visualization

This repository contains .loom files supplemental to the article. 

As a resource to community we provide .loom files that contain UMAP-clustering, cluster annotation, expression and gene regulatory data from datasets analyzed in the manuscript. 

.loom files can be downloaded here:  [GSE153846](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153846) using ftp or http links at the bottom of the page
and after unzipping, browsed interactively using [SCope platform](https://scope.aertslab.org). SCope was developed and is maintained by [Aerts lab.](https://www.aertslab.org/)

In order to browse the datasets, upload loom files by clicking on "Upload dataset" in the menu on the left-side of SCope website. Uploading may take a few minutes. Successful upload will activate a private, temporary session for the user. Each session expires after 5 days, but can be renewed by re-uploading the loom file. 
Standalone SCope apps for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/releases).
